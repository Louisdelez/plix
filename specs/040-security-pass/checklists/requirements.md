## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

## Notes

- Specification derived from comprehensive user input with explicit limits and scenarios
- All default values documented in user input (64KB packets, 256 list limits, etc.)
- Feature depends on existing infrastructure from Features 034-039
- Fuzzing infrastructure to be feature-gated per requirements
- Rate limiting extends existing token bucket from Feature 034
